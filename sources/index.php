<p>I took orders of services, music files, reading choices, and other things from a variety of sources. Here's a run-down of where they came from.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Music files come from the <a href="http://www.lcms.org/resources/audio">LCMS</a> website.</li>
  <li>The orders of service for Matins, Vespers, and Compline come from the <i>Lutheran Service Book</i>.
  <li>The reading, sermon, and prayer for Matins are taken from the Lutheran Hour Ministries <a href="http://www.lhm.org/dailydevotions.asp">daily devotional</a>.</li>
  <li>The reading for Vespers is taken from a rough draft for the <i>Lutheran Book of Worship</i>'s daily lectionary, which I found online. This is based upon the style followed by <a href="http://www.staugustineshouse.org">St. Augustine's House</a>.</li>
  <li>The order of service for Terce, Sext, and None are taken from the daily prayer booklet of St. Augustine's House, which is available on their Facebook page.</li>
</ul>
