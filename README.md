Personal Liturgy Project

The Personal Liturgy Project is my take on the ancient Christian tradition of the "liturgy of the hours," which is still observed by monks and priests.

In the liturgy, a person prays at specific times in the day. The prayers are called divine offices, and include prayers, psalms, and Bible readings.

The Personal Liturgy Project has six such offices:
* Matins, the morning prayer
* Terce, the mid-morning prayer
* Sext, the noon prayer
* None, the mid-afternoon prayer
* Vespers, the evening prayer
* Compline, the night prayer
