<p>Saying the divine offices is a tradition that hasn't really been the same from place to place. The times they are said varies by monastery and person.</p>
<p>My own personal schedule is in this format:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Matins at 7 AM, though I'm hardly ever awake at that time.</li>
  <li>Terce at 9 AM, it's usually the first office I say in a day.</li>
  <li>Sext at noon.</li>
  <li>None at 2:30 PM. In the Rule of St. Benedict it's actually suggested that None be recited at this time, instead of the three-hour interval otherwise used.</li>
  <li>Vespers at 6 PM.</li>
  <li>Compline at 9 PM.</li>
</ul>
<p>My schedule reflects that of a person who is active mostly during the day. I have seen some monastic schedules have their first office of the day (Vigils, which is equivalent to Matins) at 2:30 in the morning! On the other end, some groups observe compline as early at 8:30 PM or sooner.</p>
<p>The point isn't to pray at specific times or intervals, but to be in frequent prayer in general. If you are someone who would want to pray the offices, find a time scheme that's best for you.</p>
