<p>At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to You because of Your righteous ordinances.<br />
Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord,<br />
Who stand by night in the house of the Lord!<br />
Lift up your hands to the sanctuary<br />
And bless the Lord.<br />
May the Lord bless you from Zion,<br />
He who made heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>Psalm 119:62, Psalm 134 NASB</p>
