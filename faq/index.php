<b>Q: What is the Liturgy Project?</b><br />
A: The Liturgy Project is a structure of doing the liturgy of the hours, also called the divine office, in a way that the typical layperson can pray it without too much interference with their daily schedule. It resembles the outline described in the Rule of St. Benedict.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: How is the Liturgy Project structured?</b><br />
A: The divine offices of the project are divided into six offices. Six is a good number because it lets you pray throughout the day, and still have an undisturbed block of time for sleep. The offices are Matins (morning), Terce (mid-morning), Sext (noon), None (mid-afternoon), Vespers (evening), and Compline (night).
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: How do I use the Liturgy Project?</b><br />
A: The offices are said throughout the day at intervals of about 3 hours. It's up to you to decide what time they are prayed, depending on how they fit your schedule - just keep in mind what times they are <em>intended</em> to be prayed at. At the proper time, go to the office's page in this project and pray through the parts, which are automatically generated for you. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: What led to the creation of the Liturgy Project?</b><br />
A: The Liturgy Project was created as a result of my own interest in the divine office. I find monasticism to be interesting, and I'm also a hobbyist programmer. First I made Vespers and Compline to make these easier to follow, then I went ahead and wrote the rest of the offices.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: Where are Lauds and Prime?</b><br />
A: Lauds isn't in place because it didn't appear in the Lutheran Service Book, which is where I got the structure for Matins, Vespers, and Compline. Prime is an office which hasn't been observed for a long time, so of course it won't be included.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: What is the psalter of the project like?</b><br />
A: The psalter doesn't attempt to read the entire book of Psalms in a week or a month. Rather, there are certain psalms which are prayed at the same time every week, others that are rotated through, and others that are read during particular seasons of the church year. About 50 psalms are prayed each week, and over 100 psalms in total appear in the psalter. Read more about the psalter <a href="../psalter">here</a>.
